# Estimating PI with Darts

This a simple project to estimate the value of PI using a [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) Simulation. Simply press "Simulate" to estimate the value of PI, and the simulation will display on the side. Only so many points will actually be displayed on the side, as you can't see all the points for a very high point count. For more accurate estimations, try increasing the point count. However, this will take longer to simulate.

This project was inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/M34TO71SKGk) by Physics Girl and Veritasium on YouTube. This project uses the CSS Framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) and the Bulma Extension [Bulma Prefers Dark](https://github.com/jloh/bulma-prefers-dark), which are both licensed under the MIT license.
